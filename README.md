It is a deep nerual network project which estimates endmember in a hyperspectral image.
I am estimating the proportions of all the required materials that are to be found in a hyperspectral image of certain parts of the ground, by training a Sparse autoencoder model and using K-P Means as a pre-processing algorithm.
